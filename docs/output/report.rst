HTML summary report
===================

McClintock generates a summary report that contains information on how the run was executed, read mapping information, QC information, and a summary of component method predictions. The index page for the summary report can be found at: :code:`<output>/<sample>/results/summary/summary.html`. This page links to the pages that summarize the predictions from each method: all predictions by method, predictions for each family, predictions for each contig. :code:`<output>/<sample>/results/summary/html/<method>.html`. A page is also generated for each family, which summarizes the coverage for the family consensus sequence and the family-specific predictions from each component method. :code:`<output>/<sample>/results/summary/html/<family>.html`
